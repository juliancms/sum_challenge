# Code Challenge Test

This is a python app made for a code challenge. The idea of the application is that it compares a list of numbers with a target sum, in such a way that it prints the pairs of numbers whose sum is equivalent to the target sum. 

### Solution Notes
The time complexity of this code challenge is O(N), as the array is needed to be traversed only once. For its solution the hashing technique was used.

### Requirements
Python 3+

### Usage
Sample input:
`python3 app.py 3,4,5,64,2 7`

Sample output:
```
4,3
2,5
```
### Tests
To run the unit tests of the application you can do it with the following instruction:
`python3 test_app.py`
